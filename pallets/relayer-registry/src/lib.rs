//! # Identity Pallet
//!
//! - [`Config`]
//! - [`Call`]
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! A federated naming system, allowing for multiple registrars to be added from a specified origin.
//! Registrars can set a fee to provide identity-verification service. Anyone can put forth a
//! proposed identity for a fixed deposit and ask for review by any number of registrars (paying
//! each of their fees). Registrar judgements are given as an `enum`, allowing for sophisticated,
//! multi-tier opinions.
//!
//! Some judgements are identified as *sticky*, which means they cannot be removed except by
//! complete removal of the identity, or by the registrar. Judgements are allowed to represent a
//! portion of funds that have been reserved for the registrar.
//!
//! A super-user can remove accounts and in doing so, slash the deposit.
//!
//! All accounts may also have a limited number of sub-accounts which may be specified by the owner;
//! by definition, these have equivalent ownership and each has an individual name.
//!
//! The number of registrars should be limited, and the deposit made sufficiently large, to ensure
//! no state-bloat attack is viable.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! #### For general users
//! * `set_resource` - Set the associated identity of an account; a small deposit is reserved if not
//!   already taken.
//! * `clear_resource` - Remove an account's associated identity; the deposit is returned.
//! * `request_judgement` - Request a judgement from a registrar, paying a fee.
//! * `cancel_request` - Cancel the previous request for a judgement.
//!
//! #### For general users with sub-identities
//! * `set_subs` - Set the sub-accounts of an identity.
//! * `add_sub` - Add a sub-identity to an identity.
//! * `remove_sub` - Remove a sub-identity of an identity.
//! * `rename_sub` - Rename a sub-identity of an identity.
//! * `quit_sub` - Remove a sub-identity of an identity (called by the sub-identity).
//!
//! #### For registrars
//! * `set_fee` - Set the fee required to be paid for a judgement to be given by the registrar.
//! * `set_fields` - Set the fields that a registrar cares about in their judgements.
//! * `provide_judgement` - Provide a judgement to an identity.
//!
//! #### For super-users
//! * `add_registrar` - Add a new registrar to the system.
//! * `kill_identity` - Forcibly remove the associated identity; the deposit is lost.
